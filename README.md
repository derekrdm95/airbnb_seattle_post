**My First Repo - 2016 seattle home listing data analysis**

The repository is the first repo I made on Github. I always aspired to become a **future data scientist specialized in marketing**, combining the quantitative analysis I learned in my Economic undergraduate education with the marketing knowledge I am learning now at Northwestern Univeristy. 

This repo is a great opportunity for me to try as a data scientist, completing the **Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)** (Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Prepare Data, Data Modeling, Evaluate the Results, Deploy)

The dataset was introduced by **Udacity - Data Scientest NanoDegree**. It is a one-year Seattle Airbnb home listing data in 2016, which includes the listing price of the housing, and its housing information and review. 


***Three questions were defined and answered in our analysis***
-  What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
-  Can we use other listing information to predict the housing price?
-  The vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?


**Files in the Repository**
-  **Seattle_Airbnb_Analysis.ipynb** :Notebook with detailed code and analysis of how these three questions are approached and tackled
