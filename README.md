**My First Repo - 2016 seattle home listing data analysis**

## Motivation
The repository is the first repo I made on Github. I always aspired to become a **future data scientist specialized in marketing**, combining the quantitative analysis I learned in my Economic undergraduate education with the marketing knowledge I am learning now at Northwestern Univeristy. 

This repo is a great opportunity for me to try as a data scientist, completing the **Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)** (Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Prepare Data, Data Modeling, Evaluate the Results, Deploy)

## Data
The dataset was introduced by **Udacity - Data Scientest NanoDegree**. It is a one-year Seattle Airbnb home listing data in 2016, which includes the listing price of the housing, and its housing information and review. 

## Questions
***Three questions were defined and answered in our analysis***
-  What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
-  Can we use other listing information to predict the housing price?
-  The vibe of each Seattle neighborhood using listing descriptions?

## Files in the Repository
-  **Seattle_Airbnb_Analysis.ipynb** :Notebook with detailed code and analysis of how these three questions are approached and tackled (latest update 10/14/2018)

## Result
-  Summer (July, August) is the busiest season to visit Seattle. The price increased by 25% compared to the start of the year
-  One lasso-regression was contructed to predicted the listing price with RMSE 3580.413, RÂ² 0.571
-  Five neighbourhood were selected and TF-IDF was calculated to identify the top 5 keyword for each

## Acknowledgement
Thanks Udacity for providing this opportunity and the guidance of the mentor
